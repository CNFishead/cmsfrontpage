          ShepherdCMS was created because we believe that Christian products should be Christian-run. Too often, large
          companies lose sight of who they&apos;re serving and the deeper purpose behind their work.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Christians, we understand the profound importance of ministry for pastors â€” the responsibility, the
          challenges, and the desire to serve. While their ministry may not be our ministry, we want pastors to know
          that choosing ShepherdCMS means a commitment to walking alongside them. Your success in ministry is our
          purpose in building this platform.
