      <section className={styles.story}>
        <p>
          ShepherdCMS was created because we believe that Christian products should be Christian-run. Too often, large
          companies lose sight of who they&apos;re serving and the deeper purpose behind their work.
          <br />
          <br />
          As Christians, we understand the profound importance of ministry for pastorsâ€”the responsibility, the
          challenges, and the desire to serve. While their ministry may not be our ministry, we want pastors to know
          that choosing ShepherdCMS means a commitment to working alongside them to support their mission. Your success
          in ministry is our purpose in providing this platform.
